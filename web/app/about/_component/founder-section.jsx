              The founder of Unlisted Buzz brings with her a deep background in
              finance. With professional experience at leading financial
              institutions such as Citibank and Standard Chartered Bank, she has
              spent years understanding how financial systems work â€” and how
              investors can benefit from emerging opportunities.

            <p className="text-slate-600 text-lg">
              Her vision for Unlisted Buzz came from a simple idea: make
              unlisted investing more accessible, transparent, and backed by
              solid research. With her guidance, the platform has been designed
              to support investors who want to step into the unlisted space with
              confidence and clarity.
